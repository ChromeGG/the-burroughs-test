### The Burroughs Test (Backend)


Create a small API to help a small ﬁctional company calculate the dates on which they should pay their sales staff.  Company payroll is handled like so:

 - Sales staff are paid a regular ﬁxed base salary each month, plus a regular monthly bonus.
 - Base salaries are paid on the last day of each month unless that day is a Saturday or Sunday (a weekend), in which case they are paid on the Friday before the weekend
 - On the 15th of each month, bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless that day is a weekend, in which case they are paid on the ﬁrst Wednesday after the 15th.


Your API should accept a date as a parameter, and return the payment dates for the following 12 months, including the supplied date.  Results should be returned in CSV format.


You can assume that your API will be consumed by a browser-based company intranet, written in a front-end framework such as React.
